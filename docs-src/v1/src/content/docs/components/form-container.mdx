Form container has two purposes. The first one is adjusting the layout of the child form controls in responsive mode.
The second one is collecting the values of the child controls. The second one has no significance
since when the [ElementInternals API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) is implemented
and the form controls are as fully functional as standard HTML form elements. 
If responsive mode is unnecessary, it is recommended to use the standard `<form>` element.
